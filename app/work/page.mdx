## PeopleTime LLC
<Sub>Flutter Developer | February 2023 - Present</Sub>
I recently embarked on a project to develop a robust calendar management system using Flutter, designed to synchronize more than 100 events between a device's native calendar and Firestore. This system ensures real-time updates and data consistency, providing a seamless experience for users who need to manage a multitude of events on the go. The goal was to create a solution where every event, change, or deletion is immediately reflected across all platforms, ensuring that users always have access to the latest information.

To manage the intricate user interface and its real-time demands, I implemented comprehensive state management. By leveraging controllers, stateful widgets, and providers, the application is able to efficiently handle dynamic updates across a user base exceeding 100 individuals. This setup not only supports a responsive design but also simplifies the process of tracking UI changes, resulting in a fluid and interactive user experience even under heavy data loads.

Security and efficient data operations were also at the forefront of this project. Integrating Firebase Authentication with Firestore allowed me to manage user data securely while storing events and handling user-specific availability calculations. This ensures that each user’s information is both protected and easily accessible, contributing to a robust backend that supports the app’s real-time capabilities.

Finally, to streamline the deployment process, iOS daily builds were successfully deployed to the App Store and TestFlight using Apple Developer services. This continuous integration approach allowed for regular updates and swift bug fixes, ensuring that the app remains stable and up-to-date for all users. Overall, the project not only pushed the boundaries of real-time synchronization and state management in Flutter but also set a new standard for secure and efficient mobile app development.

## New York University - Opportunity Programs
<Sub>IT Technician Specialist | May 2022 - September 2024</Sub>
In my previous role, I provided comprehensive end-user support to over 500 students and faculty, troubleshooting both hardware and software issues across macOS and Windows platforms. My responsibilities included implementing endpoint security software—such as Cortex XDR, InsightVM, and Workspace One—in line with university standards, as well as applying security patches using BigFix and deploying group policies through Active Directory. Additionally, I enrolled devices into Active Directory and assisted with configuring group policies to maintain a secure and efficient digital environment.

Beyond technical support, I was responsible for imaging, configuring, and wiping computers to ensure seamless system setups. I also meticulously documented technical procedures and resolutions, creating a detailed knowledge base that significantly improved incident resolution times and team efficiency. This role not only honed my troubleshooting skills but also deepened my expertise in maintaining robust endpoint security and streamlining IT operations within a dynamic academic setting.

<Sub>IT & Automation | January 2022 - January 2023</Sub>
I optimized our spreadsheet infrastructure, which led to a 20% increase in data handling efficiency across more than 50 regional datasets. By automating the creation of these spreadsheets using Python scripts and Google Cloud services, I enhanced data accessibility and reliability for over 1,000 users, streamlining our regional data management processes significantly.

In addition, I performed advanced COVID data analysis by processing over 200,000 data points with Pandas and conducting web scraping with Beautiful Soup. This approach uncovered critical trends and insights that informed strategic decisions, demonstrating the power of combining automation, advanced analytics, and cloud services to drive impactful business results.

<Sub>Quality Assurance | August 2021 - January 2022</Sub>
I deployed robust data quality protocols that eliminated trend breaks in COVID-19 reporting for the US Southeast region, ensuring 100% data integrity. By serving as a key liaison for data updates from state health departments, I enabled our team to integrate new information swiftly and accurately, maintaining the consistency and reliability of our reports.

Additionally, I facilitated cross-functional communication with over 10 team leads, streamlining data entry workflows and bolstering quality assurance across the board. This collaborative approach not only enhanced our reporting process but also ensured that all stakeholders remained aligned and informed throughout the project.
